## About

This repository includes a collection of code examples and implementations that demonstrate key data structures and algorithms in C. It is designed to support learning and application of fundamental computer science concepts through practical coding examples.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: Code for essential algorithms, including sorting (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) and searching (e.g., binary search).
- **Example Code**: Practical examples to demonstrate the application of data structures and algorithms.

## Installation

To work with the code in this repository, you'll need a C compiler. Here's how to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
